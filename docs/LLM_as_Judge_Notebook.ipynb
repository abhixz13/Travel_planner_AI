        "In this notebook, we build an **LLM-based evaluator** — a \"judge\" — that uses a Large Language Model (like GPT-4) to assess translations in a **human-like, structured way**.\n",
        "\n",
        "The judge evaluates each translation across three key dimensions:\n",
        "\n",
        "- ✅ **Accuracy**: Does it preserve the original meaning?\n",
        "- 💬 **Understandability**: Is it fluent and natural in the target language?\n",
        "- 🚫 **Hallucination**: Are there added, omitted, or distorted details?\n",
