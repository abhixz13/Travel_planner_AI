# Troubleshooting: Itinerary Generation Failure

## Issue Summary

**User Report:** Itinerary generation fails with error message: "I encountered an issue generating your itinerary. Let me try a simpler approach..."

**Destination:** San Juan Islands
**Origin:** California
**Dates:** October 24-26, 2025 (2 days)

---

## Investigation Process

### Step 1: Enable Debug Logging

Created test script with `TRAVEL_PLANNER_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG` to capture full error details.

### Step 2: Run Test Generation

Simulated the exact user scenario:
```python
state["extracted_info"] = {
    "origin": "California",
    "destination": "San Juan Islands",
    "departure_date": "2025-10-24",
    "return_date": "2025-10-26",
    "duration_days": 2,
    "trip_purpose": "family activities and relaxation",
    "travel_pack": "family"
}
```

### Step 3: Captured Error Logs

```

## Root Cause Analysis

### Failure Point

**File:** `core/component_schemas.py`
**Location:** Lines 95-102 (TimeSlot validation)

```python
class TimeSlot(BaseModel):
    """A scheduled time slot within a day."""
    slot_name: Literal["morning", "afternoon", "evening"]
    time_range: str
    activity: Optional[Activity] = None
    restaurant: Optional[Restaurant] = None

    @field_validator('restaurant', 'activity')
    @classmethod
    def validate_has_content(cls, v, info):
        """Ensure at least one of activity or restaurant is set."""
        if info.data.get('activity') is None and v is None:
            raise ValueError("TimeSlot must have either an activity or restaurant")
        return v
```

### The Bug

**Problem:** Using `@field_validator` for cross-field validation

**Why it fails:**
1. Pydantic validates fields **in order of definition**
2. When validating `activity` field:
   - `activity` value is being checked (could be None)
   - `restaurant` field **hasn't been set yet**, so `info.data.get('activity')` is None
   - Check: `if None is None and None is None` â†’ raises error
3. This happens even when the LLM correctly provides ONLY a restaurant (no activity)

**Example of valid data that fails validation:**
```python
TimeSlot(
    slot_name="afternoon",
    time_range="12:00 PM - 5:00 PM",
    activity=None,           # No activity
    restaurant=Restaurant(   # Has restaurant - this is valid!
        name="Doe Bay Cafe",
        cuisine="American",
        ...
    )
)
```

When Pydantic validates the `activity` field:
- `v` (activity value) = None
- `info.data.get('activity')` = None (restaurant not set yet)
- Validator incorrectly raises: "TimeSlot must have either an activity or restaurant"

### LLM Behavior

The LLM **IS** generating correct data:
- Some slots have only activities
- Some slots have only restaurants
- This is the expected behavior

The **validator is rejecting valid data** due to field-by-field validation timing.

---

## Why Retries Don't Help

The retry mechanism adds error feedback to the prompt:
```
PREVIOUS ATTEMPT FAILED - Fix these validation errors:
days.0.afternoon.activity - Value error, TimeSlot must have either an activity or restaurant
```

But the LLM can't "fix" this because:
1. The data it generated was actually correct
2. The validator is broken, not the data
3. Each retry produces similar valid data that the validator rejects

---

## Impact

**Severity:** HIGH - Itinerary generation completely broken
**Scope:** ALL itinerary generation attempts fail
**User Experience:** Users see error message instead of itinerary

---

## Solution Required

**Change:** Replace `@field_validator` with `@model_validator(mode='after')`

A model validator runs **after all fields are set**, allowing proper cross-field validation:

```python
from pydantic import model_validator

class TimeSlot(BaseModel):
    slot_name: Literal["morning", "afternoon", "evening"]
    time_range: str
    activity: Optional[Activity] = None
    restaurant: Optional[Restaurant] = None

    @model_validator(mode='after')
    def validate_has_content(self) -> 'TimeSlot':
        """Ensure at least one of activity or restaurant is set."""
        if self.activity is None and self.restaurant is None:
            raise ValueError("TimeSlot must have either an activity or restaurant")
        return self
```

**Difference:**
- `@field_validator`: Runs during field-by-field parsing (too early)
- `@model_validator(mode='after')`: Runs after all fields are set (correct timing)

---

## Verification

After fix, the same test data should:
1. Pass validation on first attempt
2. Generate complete itinerary
3. Register all components
4. Render to markdown successfully

---

## Lessons Learned

1. **Cross-field validation requires model validators**, not field validators
2. **Field validators have limited context** - they can't reliably check other fields
3. **Structured output needs careful schema design** - validation order matters
4. **Always test with realistic data** before deploying Pydantic schemas
5. **Debug logging is essential** for diagnosing validation failures

---

## Related Issues

This same pattern exists in `DayItinerary.validate_slot_name()` (lines 54-61) but doesn't cause issues because it only reads field names, not validates cross-field constraints.

---

## Next Steps

1. Fix the `TimeSlot` validator
2. Test with the original user scenario
3. Verify all 3 attempts succeed
4. Consider adding integration tests for schema validation
5. Document best practices for Pydantic validators in structured output
