Create transport options and accommodation choices for a {pack} trip to {dest}.

**IMPORTANT: Generate ONLY transport and hotel options. Do NOT create daily activities yet.**
The user needs to select a hotel first before we plan day-by-day activities.

**APPLY COMMON SENSE - THIS IS CRITICAL:**
Trip purpose: {purpose}
Travel party: {pack}

Use human judgment when creating recommendations:
- If traveling with toddlers/infants: Prioritize shorter travel times, avoid long car rides, include nap time considerations
- If traveling with young children: Consider entertainment needs, frequent breaks
- If traveling with seniors/elderly: Choose accessible options, moderate pace
- If purpose mentions accessibility needs: Ensure all options are wheelchair accessible
- Match recommendations to the travelers' actual capabilities and comfort

**TRANSPORTATION - MANDATORY: PROVIDE AT LEAST 2 OPTIONS:**

**YOU MUST GENERATE AT LEAST 2 TRANSPORT OPTIONS.** Compare flying vs driving (or train if applicable):

For trips > 5 hours driving distance:
1. **Option 1 (Flying)**: Include flight time, airports, typical cost, pros/cons for THIS travel party
2. **Option 2 (Driving)**: Include drive time, route, cost estimate, pros/cons for THIS travel party
3. Set recommended=true on the BETTER option based on trip_purpose and travel party needs

Example for "family with toddler" on 15+ hour drive route:
```
transport_options: [
  {{
    mode: "flying",
    recommended: true,
    duration_minutes: 180,
    cost_per_person: 450,
    total_cost_estimate: 900,
    cost_notes: "for 2 adults, 1 toddler under 3 flies free",
    pros_cons: "Pros: Much faster (3 hrs vs 30 hrs), toddler can nap on plane, less stressful. Cons: More expensive, need car rental at destination."
  }},
  {{
    mode: "driving",
    recommended: false,
    duration_minutes: 1800,
    total_cost_estimate: 320,
    cost_notes: "fuel and meals for 2 adults, 1 toddler",
    pros_cons: "Pros: Cheaper, flexible schedule, own car. Cons: 30 hours is EXTREMELY challenging with toddler, requires 2 overnight stops, many rest breaks, exhausting for parents."
  }}
]
```

**DO NOT generate only 1 transport option. Users need comparison to make informed decisions.**

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
1. **Generate AT LEAST 2 transport options** (mark the recommended one with recommended=true)
2. Generate EXACTLY 3 accommodation options with real names and prices
3. **STOP HERE - DO NOT GENERATE DAILY ACTIVITIES**
   - Set days = [] (EMPTY ARRAY)
   - DO NOT create Day 1, Day 2, etc.
   - DO NOT include morning/afternoon/evening activities
   - DO NOT include restaurants or time slots
   - User must choose a hotel BEFORE we plan daily activities
4. Include 3-5 general pro tips about traveling to this destination (not activity-specific)

**VALIDATION CHECK:**
Before responding, verify:
- transport_options array has at least 2 items âœ“
- accommodation_options array has exactly 3 items âœ“
- days array is EMPTY [] âœ“
- If days has any items, DELETE THEM ALL

- Duration: {duration} days
- Dates: {facts.get('dates', {}).get('departure')} to {facts.get('dates', {}).get('return')}
- Purpose: {purpose}
- Travel party: {pack}

RESEARCH DATA TO USE:
{json.dumps(research, indent=2)}

SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS:
- Use actual hotel names, prices, and features from research
- **HANDLING COSTS:**
  - If exact cost found in research: Use it (e.g., "$129/night", "$450 per person")
  - If range in research: Use the range (e.g., "from $99", "$400-500")
  - If not in research: Use "Call for rates" or omit if no data available
  - DO NOT make up specific prices without research backing
- **CRITICAL**: For transport costs, provide BOTH:
  - cost_per_person: Per adult price (from research)
  - total_cost_estimate: Total for the entire family/group (from research)
  - cost_notes: Clear explanation (e.g., "for 2 adults, 1 toddler under 3")
- Make transport and hotel options actionable and well-researched
- Tailor recommendations to the specific travel party mentioned in purpose

Create a COMPLETE {duration}-day itinerary for a {pack} trip to {dest}.

**APPLY COMMON SENSE - THIS IS CRITICAL:**
Trip purpose: {purpose}
Travel party: {pack}

Use human judgment when creating recommendations:
- If traveling with toddlers/infants: Prioritize shorter activities (60-90 min max), avoid long car rides, include nap time considerations
- If traveling with young children: Include age-appropriate activities, family-friendly restaurants with kids menus
- If traveling with seniors/elderly: Choose accessible venues, moderate pace activities, comfortable accommodations with elevators
- If purpose mentions accessibility needs: Ensure all venues are wheelchair accessible
- Match activity intensity and duration to the travelers' actual capabilities

**TRANSPORTATION - USE EXACT OPTIONS FROM RESEARCH:**
- **CRITICAL**: Extract and use the EXACT transport options already presented in the research data
- DO NOT generate new transport modes or options
- The research already contains options that were presented to the user (e.g., Drive, Fly, Hybrid)
- Parse each option from the research recommendations and structure it
- Preserve the original option details: mode, duration, costs, pros/cons
- If research mentions "Drive", "Fly", "Hybrid" - use those exact modes
- DO NOT add "train", "bus", or other modes not mentioned in research
- Set recommended=true ONLY for the option the research recommended

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
1. Extract and use the exact transport options from research (preserve the modes mentioned - typically Drive, Fly, Hybrid)
2. Generate EXACTLY 3 accommodation options with real names and prices
3. Create a complete schedule for each day with:
   - Morning slot (9am-12pm): One activity OR restaurant
   - Afternoon slot (12pm-5pm): One activity OR restaurant
   - Evening slot (5pm-9pm): One activity OR restaurant
4. For activities: Extract duration and cost from research if available; if not mentioned, provide reasonable estimates
5. All restaurants must have specific meal times and family-friendly features
6. Include 5-10 practical pro tips specific to the travel party

TRIP DETAILS:
- Origin: {facts.get('origin', 'unspecified')}

RESEARCH DATA TO USE:

SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS:
- Use actual hotel names, prices, and features from research
- Use actual activity names, costs, and details from research
- All times must be specific (e.g., "09:30 AM", not "morning")
- **HANDLING COSTS AND DURATIONS:**
  - If exact cost found in research: Use it (e.g., "$25 per person", "$150/night")
  - If range in research: Use the range (e.g., "$15-20", "from $99")
  - If not in research: Use "Check website" or "Free" if clearly a free attraction
  - DO NOT make up specific prices (e.g., don't invent "$23" if research says nothing)
  - For duration: If research mentions it (e.g., "2-3 hours"), use it
  - If not mentioned: Provide typical estimate (e.g., "60-90 minutes for zoo visit")
- **CRITICAL**: For transport costs, provide BOTH:
  - cost_per_person: Per adult price (from research)
  - total_cost_estimate: Total for the entire family/group (from research)
  - cost_notes: Clear explanation (e.g., "for 2 adults, 1 toddler under 3")
